# Changelog

## v0.3.1.1 (2026-06-25)

### Changed

- **Capture copy says "scan," not "point at."** The home screen and the camera prompt now read "Scan a wine list" / "Tap to scan a wine list" instead of "Point at a wine list," matching what you actually do — take a photo. README and the getting-started tutorial use the same language.

### Docs

- **Conforming cleanup after the macOS client removal.** The README badge, the architecture diagram, and prose no longer imply a Mac client ("iPhone / Mac camera" and "native clients" are now iPhone-only). The camera-capture write-ups (architecture, design-decisions) dropped the macOS-only Continuity Camera retry rationale, which never applied to the iPhone's native camera.
- **Getting-started tutorial rewritten for the iOS + backend split.** `docs/tutorial/first-scan.md` no longer tells you to `swift build && swift run` a local monolith (that code is gone). It now walks through starting the backend, finding its LAN IP, generating and running the iOS app in Xcode, and pointing the app at the backend.

## v0.3.1.0 (2026-06-24)

### Removed

- **macOS client** — the app is now iOS-only. The macOS SwiftUI client had drifted out of sync with the iOS app and is removed along with its tests and package. iOS keeps every capability; nothing the iPhone app does changes.

### Changed

- **iOS Xcode project is now generated, not hand-maintained.** `ios/VisualWinelistIOS.xcodeproj` is produced from `ios/project.yml` by [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) and is no longer committed. New source files are picked up automatically, so a file can no longer be left out of the build by accident — the gap that broke device builds during the v0.3.0.0 work. Run `make project` after cloning or when adding/renaming/removing a file. CI installs XcodeGen and regenerates the project before building.

### Fixed

- The pre-commit SwiftLint hook still pointed at the removed macOS source paths; retargeted it to the iOS sources so the next Swift commit lints the right tree.

## v0.3.0.0 (2026-06-24)

### Added

- **Home screen** — the app now opens to a hub with a large "Scan a Wine List" button, a "View last results" shortcut when you have wines, and Settings. Cancelling a scan and closing the camera return here instead of dumping you back on the camera. The backend-setup banner lives here too.
- **Branded waiting screen** — the black scanning screen is replaced by a wine-bottle silhouette on a warm background that fills with the app's wine red as the scan progresses (sending → analyzing → found → notes). Respects Reduce Motion. Stage text and Cancel remain.
- **Tasting notes appear on cards as they arrive** — each card shows a small "notes ready" mark the moment its tasting note streams in, and the backend now generates notes concurrently with bottle-image fetching so the first note arrives sooner.
- **Expanded Preferences** — a real Settings screen: camera-permission status with a one-tap jump to iOS Settings when access is off, a "Save scan photos on server" toggle with a retention limit (20/50/100), a diagnostics "what's sent" disclosure, an in-app viewer for recent diagnostic reports with a "Clear telemetry data" action, and the ability to change the backend URL without reinstalling.
- **Camera-permission screen** — denying the camera now shows a clear explanation with an "Open Settings" button instead of a generic error.

### Changed

- Scan-image saving is opt-in per request from the app and always bounded by a retention limit, so saving photos can't grow disk without end.
- The camera now starts when you open it (not at launch), so the permission prompt appears on your first scan.

### Fixed

- **iOS device builds** — the app failed to build to a device because the debug-bridge modules were imported unconditionally and new screens weren't registered in the Xcode project. Fixed with conditional imports and project registration; CI now builds both the Xcode-project (device) and Swift-package paths and runs the iOS test suite so this can't regress.
- Backend `GET /telemetry/scans` is reliable: it honors the telemetry on/off setting and skips a single corrupt stored row instead of failing the whole listing.

## v0.2.13.0 (2026-06-24)

### Added

- **Stage-accurate scan progress** — the scanning screen now names each phase as it happens: "Sending photo…" → "Getting ready to analyze…" → "Analyzing the wine list…" → "Found N wines…" → "Getting tasting notes… (3/19)". The phases are driven by real backend signals (an immediate readiness flush and a first-token marker from the model), so "Sending photo…" no longer lingers for the entire analysis. The tasting-notes counter lives in the always-visible bottom bar instead of scrolling out of view.
- **Opt-in scan diagnostics** — a "Send Diagnostics?" toggle (off by default, in Preferences and iOS Settings) posts per-scan timing to the backend at `POST /telemetry/scan` (completed, cancelled, or errored scans). `GET /telemetry/scans` lists recent reports for inspection. No photo or wine data is sent — timing only. Stored in a new `scan_telemetry` table, keyed by scan id.
- **Scan-image capture for inspection** — optional `SAVE_SCAN_IMAGES` backend setting (off by default) persists each uploaded photo to `scans/{scan_id}.jpg`, so a telemetry row can be tied to exactly what the model saw.
- **Faster first bottle image** — the backend now pre-generates the card-size image while the scan is still running, so the gallery fills without a second on-demand resize round-trip.
- **Deeper scan timing (perf HUD, DEBUG)** — the overlay decomposes the request into DNS / TCP / upload / server-wait phases, adds server-side receive time, time-to-first-wine, and per-wine Brave search vs download timing, a build marker (version + git SHA + build time), a malformed-SSE counter, and a tunable upload size.

### Fixed

- **Image variant race** — concurrent requests for the same wine image no longer double-generate the resized WebP (per-wine generation lock; the lock releases even if image decoding fails).
- **Perf HUD recoverable** — closing the debug overlay with the ✕ no longer strands it off-screen; it re-homes to the corner and the drag is clamped so it can't be lost.
- **Dropped end-of-scan timing** — the transaction-metrics rows (DNS/TCP/upload) were being discarded on normal scan completion; they now record correctly.
- **Telemetry listing consistency** — `GET /telemetry/scans` now honors `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` (returns 404 when off, matching `POST`), and a single corrupt stored payload is skipped rather than failing the whole listing.

## v0.2.12.0 (2026-06-23)

### Added

- **4-across wine grid** — Grid columns increased from 2 to 4, spacing tightened from 12 to 8 pt. ~8 wines visible per scroll on iPhone 15. Card text simplified to wine name only (caption2, one line, truncated) — vintage removed from card overlay; images become primary at this density.
- **Full-bottle detail image** — Fixed 280 pt image panel with blur-background + scaledToFit: the full wine bottle label is visible without scrolling. Wine name, vintage, price, and section appear in a gradient overlay at the bottom of the image. Tasting notes begin immediately below the fold.
- **Preferences screen** — Gear icon in the grid toolbar navigates to a native SwiftUI Form with a "Show price on card" toggle (persisted via `@AppStorage`) and an About section showing the app version.
- **Price overlay badge** — When "Show price on card" is enabled, extracted price appears as a translucent capsule pill at the top-left of each wine card.
- **Consistent version reporting** — All clients (iOS, macOS, backend `/health`, web) now report the version from the single `VERSION` file at the repo root. Backend `/health` response includes a `version` field.

### Fixed

- **Detail image fallback** — A corrupt or partial image response from the backend no longer replaces the working card thumbnail with a placeholder. The detail view now falls back to the grid thumbnail when the high-resolution fetch is undecodable.
- **Detail view thumbnail→detail fade** — The cross-fade transition when the high-resolution image loads was silently broken by the detail view refactor (`.transition(.opacity)` was dead code on an always-present ZStack). Fixed by adding `.id()` to drive SwiftUI identity on image change.
- **Price overlay wrap** — Price text on small cards now truncates to a single line instead of wrapping.

## v0.2.11.0 (2026-06-23)

### Added

- **Scan pipeline timing HUD** (iOS DEBUG builds only) — a draggable, collapsible translucent overlay displays live instrumentation after each scan: screenshot dimensions and size (KB), `http_ok` latency (TCP+TLS+upload+server queue), TTFB, Ollama extraction wall time (`ollama_ms`), image fetch phase (`image_ms`), sommelier phase (`sommelier_ms`), and total scan duration (`total_ms`). A waterfall bar chart shows per-event timing (`wine[n]`, `image[n]`, `complete`).
- **Scan timing columns in ScanLog** — the backend `scan_log` table now records `ollama_ms`, `image_ms`, `sommelier_ms`, and `total_ms` for each completed scan. Existing databases are upgraded automatically on next startup via additive `ALTER TABLE` DDL (idempotent; existing rows retain NULL for the new columns).
- **`image_ms` and `sommelier_ms` in SSE complete event** — all four timing fields now flow from the backend SSE payload through the iOS HUD; the expanded panel shows them individually.

### Infrastructure

- `DebugStore`, `DebugHUD`, `WaterfallView` — new `#if DEBUG`-only Swift types wired to `IOSScanSession` delegate callbacks and `WineListViewModel`. All DebugStore writes from the URLSession delegate queue are dispatched via `Task { @MainActor in }` to respect the `@Observable` main-actor invariant. Stale-task guard via `debugGen` counter prevents cancelled scan metrics from leaking into the next scan's HUD.
- Migration exception handling narrowed to `OperationalError` (was bare `except Exception`) so non-schema errors (DB locked, disk full) surface at startup rather than silently crippling metric persistence.
- `ollama_client`: mid-stream httpx errors (`RemoteProtocolError`, `ReadError`, etc.) now re-raised as `OSError` so they reach the `OLLAMA_DOWN` handler rather than surfacing as opaque `INTERNAL_ERROR` responses.
- `_write_scan_log()` helper extracted — both `INTERNAL_ERROR` and happy-path construction sites now share a single implementation; timing fields are never accidentally omitted on one path.

### Tests

- **Backend**: 184 tests (was 179) — 5 new test functions covering `total_ms` in SSE and ScanLog (happy path + INTERNAL_ERROR + Ollama failure + migration idempotency); existing Ollama-error tests extended with ScanLog persistence and timing assertions.

## v0.2.10.0 (2026-06-23)

### Fixed

- **Shutter button visible on all backgrounds** — The capture button now has a drop shadow so it stays visible when the camera preview is white or bright (e.g. during warm-up or scanning a light-coloured menu).
- **"Scan more" and Trash unblock immediately after extraction** — Both action buttons were disabled until all bottle images finished downloading (30–90s on slow networks). They now re-enable as soon as the backend sends the completion event, while image downloads continue in the background.
- **Vintage and price labels in wine detail** — The vintage year now appears alongside a "vintage" label so it's never confused with a price or section header.

### Infrastructure

- **iOS QA automation** — Integrated DebugBridge + StateServer (DEBUG-only HTTP server) and ObjC touch synthesis (`DebugBridgeTouch`) so the gstack `/ios-qa` skill can drive the app on a real device via USB without Xcode.
- **Session security** — `POST /session/release` now requires a valid session-ID header, preventing one agent from evicting another's active QA session.

### Tests

- Regression test for `isScanning` early-release: verifies the scan buttons unblock at the `.complete` SSE event, not after image downloads finish.

## v0.2.9.0 (2026-06-23)

### Added

- **Gallery density control** — Toolbar button group (4 / 8 / 12 / 16 columns) lets curators switch between a spacious 4-column view and a dense 16-column overview. Selection persists to `localStorage` across reloads. Page size scales with density (density × 5 rows per page), so the total wine count per page stays proportional.

### Fixed

- **Image cache staleness** — `searchWines` and the PATCH response now embed `?v={updated_at_timestamp}` in every image URL. After a label upload, the URL changes, so the browser fetches the fresh image instead of serving the Chrome `max-age=86400` cache entry. `Cache-Control` changed from `public, max-age=86400` to `public, no-cache` to force ETag revalidation on subsequent loads.
- **Escape closes both zoom modal and detail panel** — Pressing Escape while the label-zoom modal was open fired both the zoom handler and the WineDetailPanel handler, closing the detail panel unexpectedly. The zoom Escape handler now calls `e.stopPropagation()` so only the modal closes.
- **Stale density-change fetch** — Changing density while on page > 1 triggered two simultaneous `searchWines` calls (one with the old page, one with page=1). A `fetchId` counter now discards the stale response so only the second, correct call updates the gallery.
- **Space key scrolls page** — `e.preventDefault()` added to the `Space` key handler on WineCard so pressing Space to select a card no longer also scrolls the gallery.
- **"Upload" button label** — The image upload button in WineDetailPanel now reads "Upload" (was "Replace").

### Tests

- **Backend**: 179 tests — new coverage for `?v=` timestamp in `searchWines` and PATCH responses; strengthened assertions to verify the timestamp is a non-zero integer.
- **Frontend**: 94 tests — density control (button rendering, default, localStorage persistence/restore/fallback, pageSize calculation, page reset); WineCard (zoom open/close, Space/Enter/Escape key behaviors); WineDetailPanel ("Upload" label assertion).

## v0.2.8.0 (2026-06-23)

### Added

- **Curator search query** — `GET /wines/{id}/image-candidates` now accepts `?q=` to override the auto-built Brave query. The picker shows the active query in an editable input; submitting triggers a re-search without closing the panel.
- **Image candidate picker expansion** — the picker is now a panel body (flex, fills parent height) instead of an absolute overlay. Shows a 3×3 grid of 9 candidates with aspect-ratio-correct thumbnails.
- **Wine stats endpoint** — `GET /wines/stats` returns `{total, verified, with_image}`. The curator header now displays image coverage (%) updated after every image action.
- **Scan log** — each completed scan writes a `ScanLog` row (scan_id, timestamp, wine_count, cache_hits). Writes at both error-path and happy-path CompleteEvent sites; failures are logged and swallowed so they never block scan delivery.
- **Recent scans endpoint** — `GET /scans/recent?limit=10` returns the N most recent scan summaries and an aggregate `hit_rate` (cache hits ÷ total wines, capped at 100, null when no data).
- **Hit rate in curator header** — the scan hit rate (from `/scans/recent`) is displayed in the header alongside image coverage.

### Fixed

- **Portrait-score rejects negative dimensions** — `_portrait_score` now guards `h <= 0 or w <= 0`, preventing negative-dimension Brave results from sorting above valid candidates.
- **Vintage regex is word-bounded** — `vintageOf()` in `ImageCandidatePicker` now uses `\b...\b` anchors, preventing year extraction from catalog numbers like `SKU-199930`.
- **Candidate grid key stability** — React grid uses `c.url` as key instead of array index; avoids stale-DOM morphing when re-searching returns a different candidate list.

### Tests

- **Backend**: 177 tests — new coverage for `GET /wines/stats` (empty + mixed data), `GET /wines/{id}/image-candidates` with custom `?q=`, `GET /scans/recent` (empty, with data, hit_rate cap, limit param), and `fetch_image_candidates` custom query forwarding.
- **Frontend**: 72 tests — picker tests updated for new `{candidates, query}` return shape; added `populates query input from response` and `search button triggers re-fetch with custom query`.

## v0.2.7.0 (2026-06-22)

### Added

- **WebP variant serving** — `GET /wines/{id}/image?size=thumb|card|detail|full` serves a named WebP variant (thumb=120 px, card=320 px, detail=800 px) or the original JPEG (`full`). Responses include `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` and a source-keyed ETag derived from `mtime+size`; matching `If-None-Match` returns 304.
- **Pre-generated variants** — after each upload or image-from-url, all three WebP variants (thumb/card/detail) are generated eagerly via `_generate_all_variants()`, eliminating first-serve latency and thundering-herd on concurrent requests.
- **iOS `fetchImage` size parameter** — `BackendClient.fetchImage(wineId:size:)` now accepts a `size` string and appends `?size=<size>` to the request URL, enabling callers to request appropriately sized images.
- **iOS `resizeForUpload` testability** — the function is now a package-level (not `ContentView`-scoped) function, making it accessible via `@testable import` in unit tests.

### Changed

- **`DELETE /wines/{id}` cleans up image files** — deleting a wine record now also removes all three WebP variant files and the source JPEG, preventing orphaned files from accumulating on disk.
- **iOS `resizeForUpload` runs off main thread** — the 4032×3024 camera photo resize now runs in `Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)`, keeping the main actor free during CPU-bound JPEG scaling.
- **Atomic variant writes** — `_generate_variant` writes to `{path}.tmp` and uses `os.replace()` for the final rename, ensuring readers never observe a partial WebP file.
- **`set_image_from_url` adds Content-Length pre-check** — the `content-length` header is checked before downloading the body; responses that declare over 2 MB are rejected immediately with HTTP 422.

### Fixed

- **SSRF redirect bypass** — `set_image_from_url` now passes `follow_redirects=False` to httpx. Previously a 301/302 to an RFC-1918 address bypassed the IP validator.
- **Pillow blocking the event loop** — non-JPEG image conversion in `set_image_from_url` and `brave_client._download_image` now runs in `asyncio.to_thread`, preventing Pillow's CPU-bound decode from blocking the asyncio event loop.
- **`_generate_variant` opens source file safely** — `_PILImage.open()` is now wrapped in `try/except Exception` (re-raised as `OSError`), and a zero-width degenerate-image guard prevents ZeroDivisionError during aspect-ratio computation.
- **`IMAGE_WEBP_QUALITY` startup validation** — `lifespan()` raises `ValueError` if the configured value is outside `[0, 100]`, failing fast instead of silently producing corrupt WebP output.
- **`os.path.getsize` race on variant path** — the `getsize` call in `get_wine_image` is now wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` with an `OSError` guard that returns `-1` if the file disappears between write and stat.

### Tests

- **Backend**: 169 tests — new coverage for variant serving (thumb/card/detail/full), `_generate_variant` unit tests, `_delete_variants` cleanup, upload rollback on missing record, `image-from-url` Content-Length pre-check, and Pillow format normalization path.
- **iOS**: `ImagePipelineTests` — `ResizeForUploadTests` (downscale, passthrough) and `FetchImageSizeTests` (size param appended, default is `card`) using `MockURLProtocol`.

## v0.2.6.0 (2026-06-22)

### Added

- **iOS shimmer animation on loading cards** — wine cards now show a sweeping shimmer highlight while the bottle image is being fetched, matching the macOS loading experience.
- **iOS app icon** — the iOS app now has a custom wine/grapes icon (1024×1024) instead of a generic placeholder.
- **Screen-sleep prevention during scan** — the iPhone display no longer dims or auto-locks while a scan is in progress; the idle timer resets as soon as scanning finishes or the app is backgrounded.

### Changed

- **Fixed-width 2-column iOS grid** — wine cards are sized by dividing the screen width into two equal columns via GeometryReader, eliminating card-width jitter from flexible grid sizing.
- **Bottle-proportioned card aspect ratio** — wine cards use a 3:5 portrait aspect ratio on both iOS and macOS, with `scaledToFit` display so the full bottle height is visible without cropping.

### Fixed

- **"Try again" after a failed append scan returned to the wine grid** — tapping "Try again" from an error clears `errorMessage`, which was triggering a navigation observer to push to the grid (because wines existed) instead of returning to the camera. The observer now only reacts to error-set transitions, not error-clear ones.
- **Zero-width cards on zero-size GeometryReader first pass** — added a `max(1, ...)` floor to the iOS grid's card-width calculation, preventing negative `GridItem(.fixed(...))` sizes on the layout's initial pass.
- **Idle timer stuck enabled on backgrounding mid-scan** — `.onDisappear` on `ContentView` now unconditionally resets `isIdleTimerDisabled = false`, so the screen cannot stay permanently awake if the app exits the view while scanning.
- **Shimmer animation linger after card leaves viewport** — `.onDisappear { phase = -0.4 }` was added to both iOS and macOS `ShimmerOverlay`, resetting the animation target when the card scrolls out of view.
- **Append scan phase guard on error** — if a wine scan returned an error while wines existed, starting a subsequent scan's `performScan` cleared `errorMessage`, which falsely triggered a transition to `.grid` before new wines arrived. Phase now only transitions to `.grid` after a successful scan completion.
- **`URLError.cancelled` type-narrowing** — the NSURLErrorCancelled catch block previously matched any `NSError` with code -999, including errors from unrelated domains. Replaced with a typed `as? URLError, urlErr.code == .cancelled` check.

## v0.2.5.1 (2026-06-22)

### Fixed

- **`scan()` swallowed `CancellationError` on iOS and macOS** — When Swift cancelled a Task awaiting `session.bytes(for:)`, URLSession threw `URLError.cancelled`, which `scan()`'s broad `catch is URLError` mapped to `BackendError.unreachable` rather than re-throwing `CancellationError`. This gap was present despite the same carve-out being correctly applied to `checkHealth()` and `fetchImage()`. Found during pre-landing adversarial review; fix is consistent with the other two methods.
- **iOS `scan()` ignored injected URLSession configuration** — `BackendClient.scan()` called `IOSScanSession.make(request:)` without forwarding `session.configuration`, silently falling back to the default session. `MockURLProtocol` could never intercept scan requests in unit tests because the injected session was unused. Fixed: `session.configuration` is now forwarded to `IOSScanSession.make(request:configuration:)`.

### Tests

- **macOS `MacOSMockProtocolRegistry` actor** replaces static `MockURLProtocol` variables and `@unchecked Sendable`; each test configures state via `async` setters; `tearDown()` is `async throws` and calls `await reset()`. Eliminates a test teardown race where `stopLoading()` could call into an invalidated `URLProtocolClient` on in-flight request cancellation.
- **`MockURLProtocol.loadingTask` cancellation** — `startLoading()` stores the spawned `Task<Void, Never>`; `stopLoading()` cancels it before signalling `onStopLoading`, preventing fire-and-forget callbacks from racing against test teardown.
- **6 new cancellation tests** — 3 macOS (`testCheckHealthCancelledRethrowsCancellationError`, `testFetchImageCancelledRethrowsCancellationError`, `testScanCancelledRethrowsCancellationError`) and 3 iOS (`testIOSCheckHealthCancelledRethrowsCancellationError`, `testIOSFetchImageCancelledRethrowsCancellationError`, `testIOSBackendClientScanForwardsSessionConfiguration`) verify the `URLError.cancelled` → `CancellationError` contract and the session configuration forwarding fix. macOS test suite: 59 → 60 tests.

## v0.2.5.0 (2026-06-22)

### Fixed

- **Unbounded memory growth during SSE** — The line buffer in both iOS and macOS SSE parsers now caps at 1 MB. Malformed oversized pseudo-lines from the server are discarded rather than accumulated.
- **Scanner lock not released on structured cancellation** — When Swift's `withThrowingTaskGroup` unwinds the scan loop (e.g., view dismissed), the URLSession `onTermination` handler now propagates the cancel to `IOSScanSession`, releasing the server's SCANNER_BUSY lock promptly.
- **Image fetch tasks not cancelled on scan abort** — Concurrent image fetches now run inside `withThrowingTaskGroup`. When a scan is cancelled, all in-flight image tasks are cancelled cooperatively. Previously, orphaned image tasks continued running after the scan view was dismissed.
- **`CancellationError` swallowed in image fetch** — The `handleImageEvent` catch block now re-throws `CancellationError` before the generic error handler, allowing `withThrowingTaskGroup` to propagate cooperative cancellation through child tasks correctly.
- **iOS SSE lineBuffer cap was zero** — `sseLineBufferMaxBytes` was defined as a self-reference (`= sseLineBufferMaxBytes`), reducing the 1 MB cap to zero and silently discarding all incoming SSE bytes on iOS.
- **`handleImageEvent` compile error** — The function was declared `async` without `throws`, making `throw CancellationError()` inside it a build-breaking error. Fixed in both iOS and macOS targets.

### Changed

- **`BackendClient` maps `URLError` to `BackendError.unreachable`** in `checkHealth()` and `fetchImage()` (iOS and macOS), so network failures surface a consistent error type to the ViewModel.
- **Docker base images pinned to SHA256 digests** (`python:3.13-slim` and `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`) to guard against supply-chain substitution.
- **Backend enforces `--workers 1`** in `Dockerfile CMD`; the rationale (single-Ollama concurrency constraint) is documented inline in `scan.py`.
- **CI coverage gate hardened** — `llvm-cov` failures now exit non-zero; an empty `TOTAL` line is treated as a gate failure rather than a silent pass.
- **CI adds gitleaks full-history scan** — `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` pinned to SHA (v2.3.9) runs on every push to catch secrets committed anywhere in the repo history.
- **Web curator adds "Verified first" sort** — the sort dropdown now surfaces curated wines at the top of the search results.

### Added

- **iOS `BackendClient` exposes injectable `URLSession`** for test isolation, enabling `MockURLProtocol` to intercept network calls in unit tests without a live server.
- **iOS actor-isolated `MockProtocolRegistry`** replaces static `MockURLProtocol` variables, eliminating the `@unchecked Sendable` suppressor and a test teardown race on in-flight request cancellation.

## v0.2.4.2 (2026-06-21)

### Fixed

- **iOS wine names with accented characters** — Wines like "Château" were silently dropped when URLSession split the SSE payload mid-character across delivery chunks. The line buffer now accumulates raw bytes before UTF-8 decoding, so multibyte characters survive any delivery boundary.
- **Scanner lock not released on client disconnect** — Cancelling a scan on iOS or macOS left the server's SCANNER_BUSY lock held for up to 5 minutes because the underlying URLSession connection stayed open after the consumer exited. Cancelling the stream now propagates immediately to the URLSession, releasing the lock promptly.
- **JPEG spoofing via Content-Type header** — The image upload endpoint accepted any file declared as `image/jpeg` without inspecting content. It now verifies the JPEG SOI magic bytes (`\xff\xd8`), rejecting non-JPEG files regardless of Content-Type.
- **Corrupted SSE bytes misinterpreted as event boundary** — An invalid UTF-8 byte in a server response fell back to an empty string, which SSEParser treats as the event-dispatch signal. Wine events could be silently split into two malformed events. The decoder now substitutes U+FFFD for invalid sequences, preserving parser state.

## v0.2.4.1 (2026-06-21)

### Fixed

- **TOCTOU race in scanner lock** — `POST /scan` previously claimed `_scanning = True`
  inside the `_scan_sse` async generator body, which FastAPI only begins iterating after
  returning `StreamingResponse`. Two concurrent requests could both pass the `if _scanning:`
  guard before either set the flag. Lock is now claimed synchronously in the HTTP handler
  before returning `StreamingResponse` with no `await` in between.
- **Orphaned image fetch tasks on client disconnect** — `asyncio.ensure_future()` calls in
  `_scan_sse` were not stored, leaving background Brave fetch tasks running untracked when
  the client dropped the connection. Tasks are now tracked and cancelled in the `finally`
  block alongside `extraction_task`.
- **iOS SSE CRLF line endings** — `IOSScanSession` split on `\n` but did not strip trailing
  `\r`, causing CRLF-terminated lines from HTTP proxies to be fed to `SSEParser` with a
  trailing carriage-return, silently failing to parse event types. macOS `BackendClient`
  already handled CRLF; iOS is now in parity.
- **iOS SSE stream-end without trailing blank line** — `IOSScanSession.didCompleteWithError`
  now flushes any remaining bytes in `lineBuffer` and calls `parser.feed(line: "")` before
  finishing the continuation, dispatching the final pending SSE event when the server closes
  without a trailing `\n\n`. macOS `BackendClient.scan()` already had this flush; iOS is now
  in parity.
- **`NotesSSEPayload.pairings` silences type errors** — both macOS and iOS decoded `pairings`
  with `try? c.decodeIfPresent(...)`, silently returning `[]` on any type mismatch (e.g.
  server sends a string instead of an array). Changed to `try c.decodeIfPresent` so type
  errors propagate to `.parseError` rather than producing silent empty pairings.
- **macOS SSE stream-end flush** — `BackendClient.scan()` calls `parser.feed(line: "")`
  after the byte loop, dispatching any pending SSE event when the server closes without a
  trailing `\n\n`.

### Changed

- **`BackendClient` injectable `URLSession`** — the initializer now accepts an optional
  `session: URLSession` parameter (default `.shared`), enabling unit tests to inject a
  `MockURLProtocol`-backed session without a live server.
- **`.parseError` events logged** — both macOS and iOS `WineListViewModel` now print
  `[SSE] parse error` instead of silently discarding parse failures, making systematic
  backend regressions observable in console output.
- **Coverage thresholds enforced** — vitest now fails if React statement coverage drops below
  80%; pytest fails if Python line coverage drops below 80%. Current baselines: React 87%,
  Python 89%.
- **CI: `web-test` job guard** — the TypeScript test job now skips gracefully when
  `web/package.json` is absent, matching the existing `web-lint` guard pattern.

### Tests

- Python test suite: 110 tests — 8 new tests covering the TOCTOU scanner-lock race, lock
  release on `GeneratorExit`, and image-task cancellation in `_scan_sse`.
- Swift XCTest: 52 tests — added `BackendClient` CRLF, `fetchImage` 200/404, and `URLError`
  mapping tests; iOS `IOSScanSession` cancel-stops-stream and invalid-URL tests;
  `NotesSSEPayload` absent-pairings and `.parseError` passthrough coverage.
- React vitest suite: 48 tests — added `Pagination` component tests (5) and `App` error-path
  tests for `searchWines` rejection and `deleteWine` rejection (2).

## v0.2.5 (2026-06-21)

### Added

- **Curator: status filter** — `GET /wines/search` now accepts `status=all|verified|unverified|no_image`
  to filter the curator grid by curation state.
- **Curator: sort controls** — sort by `name`, `producer`, `created_at`, or `updated_at` with
  `order=asc|desc`. React UI exposes a sort dropdown alongside the status filter.
- **Curator: `verified_total` count** — search responses now include `verified_total: int` so the
  header can show "N verified" without a separate round-trip.
- **Curator: image upload** — `POST /wines/{id}/image` accepts a replacement JPEG (≤ 10 MB) and
  stores it in the image cache. Accessible from the wine detail panel.
- **Curator: inline field editing** — `PATCH /wines/{id}` accepts partial updates for name,
  producer, vintage, variety, and appellation. The detail panel shows an inline edit form.
- **Curator: delete with confirmation** — `DELETE /wines/{id}` removes a record from the cache.
  The React UI shows an animated `ConfirmModal` before executing.
- **`timedFetch`** — all React API calls are now wrapped in a timing shim that logs per-request
  duration to the console, making it easy to spot slow backend calls in devtools.
- **macOS reconnect detection** — `WineListViewModel.notesIncomplete` is set to `true` when the
  SSE stream closes without `event:complete`, surfacing the "connection dropped mid-scan" banner
  in the macOS Wine Detail view.
- **`WineListViewModel` testability** — the view model now takes a `BackendClientProtocol`
  dependency, enabling unit tests with a `MockBackendClient` without a real SSE server.
- **DB indexes** — six single-column indexes added for `name`, `producer`, `appellation`,
  `verified`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` to speed up common filter/sort queries.
- **Image `Cache-Control` header** — `GET /wines/{id}/image` now sets
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` so browsers/CDNs cache bottle photos for 24 hours.
- **Scan timing metrics** — `event:complete` now includes `ollama_ms`, `image_ms`,
  `sommelier_ms`, and `total_ms` timing fields for performance monitoring.
- **Lazy image loading** — wine card `<img>` tags in the React curator now use `loading="lazy"`
  to defer off-screen image fetches.

### Fixed

- **Path traversal in image upload** — `wine_id` from the URL path is now validated against
  `os.path.realpath` to prevent directory traversal (e.g. `../../etc/...`).
- **Blocking file I/O in async handler** — `open()/write()` in the image upload handler is now
  wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread` to avoid blocking the event loop during large uploads.
- **`update_fields` field allowlist** — `cache.update_fields` now filters incoming dict keys to
  `_EDITABLE_FIELDS`, preventing unconstrained `setattr` from setting non-editable columns.
- **`update_image` race condition** — if a wine record is deleted between the initial lookup
  and the file write, the orphaned file is cleaned up and HTTP 404 is returned (was HTTP 200).
- **`handleVerify` double-count** — `verified_total` delta in `handleVerify` now computes
  against the previous in-state `verified` value rather than using a fixed `+1/-1`, preventing
  double-counting on rapid re-clicks.
- **Stale `actionError` across wines** — action error messages are now cleared when the selected
  wine changes, preventing wine A's error from showing on wine B's detail panel.
- **`WinePatch` blank string validation** — `PATCH /wines/{id}` now rejects blank/whitespace-only
  strings with HTTP 422, preventing empty names from being written through direct API calls.
- **`page=0` negative offset** — `GET /wines/search?page=0` previously computed `OFFSET=-20`,
  which SQLite silently mapped to 0, returning duplicate page-1 results. `page` now enforces
  `ge=1` via `Query`.
- **Scan timing sentinel** — `t_extraction_end` and `t_phase1_end` in `scan.py` now use
  `Optional[float] = None` instead of `0.0`, replacing falsy-checks with explicit `is not None`
  guards.
- **`handleUpdate` `verified_total` tracking** — when a PATCH response returns a different
  `verified` value, `verified_total` is now adjusted accordingly (defensive guard).

### Tests

- Python test suite: 102 tests (was 40), covering image upload, field patch, search filter/sort,
  and cache service edge cases.
- React vitest suite: 34 tests (was 0), covering `WineCard`, `WineDetailPanel`, `ConfirmModal`,
  and all API client functions including `patchWine` and `uploadWineImage`.
- Swift XCTest: macOS `WineListViewModel` reconnect detection (4 test cases).

## v0.2.4 (2026-06-21)

### Fixed

- **iOS: all wines now appear after scanning** — the scan was silently cancelled
  as soon as the first wine arrived. `scanningView.onDisappear` was firing
  `cancelScan()` when SwiftUI transitioned to the grid view on the first wine
  event, killing the SSE connection. The Cancel button already handles
  intentional cancellation; the `onDisappear` hook was removed.
- **Backend: scanner lock released on client disconnect** — if the iOS app
  navigated away mid-scan, `_scanning` stayed `True` permanently and every
  subsequent scan returned HTTP 503 `SCANNER_BUSY` until the server restarted.
  The `_scan_sse` async generator now wraps its full body in `try/finally`,
  which correctly fires on `GeneratorExit` (a `BaseException`) when the client
  drops the SSE connection.

### Changed

- **Ollama image resolution increased to 2048px** — the maximum image dimension
  sent to Ollama was raised from 1024px to 2048px to improve text legibility on
  dense wine lists. With `num_ctx=8192`, a 2048px photo produces ~1100 visual
  tokens — well within budget while preserving fine-print detail that matters
  for accurate wine extraction.

## v0.2.3 (2026-06-20)

### Chore

- **SwiftLint** — added SwiftLint v0.63.3 to pre-commit hooks and CI
  (`swift-ci` job). Config in `.swiftlint.yml`: 120/140 line length,
  `identifier_name` with excluded `[id, ok, ns]`, `cyclomatic_complexity`
  warning=15/error=30. Clean baseline: 0 errors, 13 warnings (test short vars
  and iOS `WineListViewModel` complexity are the known warnings).
- **swift-format enforcement** — pre-commit hook and CI step now enforce
  formatting for all Swift under `Sources/`, `Tests/`, `ios/Sources/`,
  `ios/Tests/`. Uses format+diff pattern (replaces the advisory `lint`
  subcommand that exits 0 on violations). 10 source files reformatted to
  match `.swift-format` config.

## v0.2.2 (2026-06-20)

### Fixed

- **SSE empty-line bug** — `URLSession.AsyncBytes.lines` silently drops empty
  lines, which are the SSE event-boundary signal. `BackendClient.scan()` now
  iterates raw bytes, splitting on `\n` and preserving empty lines exactly as
  `IOSScanSession` does. Previously the macOS client always received 0 wines.
- **Qwen3-VL thinking mode** — `"think": False` is now sent in Ollama options
  (primary) with an assistant pre-fill `{` as belt-and-suspenders for older
  Ollama builds. Without this, Qwen3-VL emits a `<think>` block before JSON
  output, which the token-buffer logic cannot parse.
- **`_scanning` lock covers sommelier phase** — the busy-lock (`_scanning`) was
  previously released before Phase 2 (sommelier notes), allowing a concurrent
  scan to interleave with the single-instance Ollama session. Lock now covers
  the full scan lifecycle.
- **Ollama pre-fill defensive check** — `ollama_client.py` now guards against
  future Ollama builds that might echo the pre-fill `{` in streamed tokens,
  which would produce malformed `{{...}` JSON.
- **Docker startup ordering** — `curator` now depends on `api` with
  `condition: service_healthy` (was `service_started`), so nginx only starts
  routing traffic after the FastAPI server passes its health check.
- **`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` default removed** — `.env.example` no longer sets a
  default `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, preventing Docker-internal URL bleed-through when
  running outside Docker.

### Added

- **Docker Compose curator profile** — `docker compose --profile curator up`
  starts the React curator frontend at `http://localhost`, proxying API calls
  to the backend container internally.
- **`scripts/test-scan.py`** — diagnostic script to exercise the `/scan` SSE
  endpoint directly and report per-wine extraction results.

## v0.2.1 (2026-06-20)

### Security

- **Secret scanning pre-commit hook** — gitleaks v8.27.2 is now enforced as the
  first pre-commit hook, blocking commits that contain API keys or credentials
  before they reach git history. See `.gitleaks.toml` for allowlisted placeholder
  values.
- **Non-root Docker container** — the backend FastAPI process runs as a pinned
  system user (UID 1001) rather than root, limiting blast radius of a future RCE.
  On Linux hosts, volume directories (`./image-cache`, `./data`) must be
  pre-created with `chown -R 1001:1001` before starting; macOS Docker Desktop
  handles this transparently.
- **`.env` permission guidance** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` now documents `chmod 600 .env`
  and the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` configuration option for contributors.

## v0.2.0 (2026-06-18)

### Added

- **iOS connection-drop indicator** — if the backend SSE stream closes before delivering
  all tasting notes, wines missing notes now show a `wifi.slash` banner ("Tasting notes
  unavailable — connection dropped mid-scan") in the detail view instead of silently
  showing nothing. Wines that already received notes are unaffected.
- **Canonical WineObject schema** — `shared/wine-schema.json` defines the 10 extraction
  fields as a JSON Schema draft-07 document. Contributors can rely on this as the single
  source of truth when syncing `WineObject.swift`, `WineObject` Pydantic model, and
  `wine.ts`.
- **CI schema drift enforcement** — `backend/tests/test_schema_sync.py` runs on every
  push and fails if the Python Pydantic model drifts from `wine-schema.json`, catching
  field mismatches before they reach clients.

## v0.1.0 (2026-06-16)

Initial proof-of-concept release. macOS app that photographs a printed or
handwritten restaurant wine list and turns it into a visual grid of tappable
bottle images, using a local Ollama model (Qwen3-VL) for text extraction and
Brave Image Search for bottle photos.

- Camera capture with retry on transient macOS Continuity Camera "Reactions"
  video-effect glitches
- Local Ollama (Qwen3-VL) streaming extraction of wines from a photographed
  list
- Brave Image Search bottle photo lookup, with ranked (non hard-filtered)
  candidate selection and per-attempt failure logging
- Wine grid view with a "Clear" button to reset and a "Scan more" flow for
  multi-page lists
- Wine detail sheet with extraction debug info (raw OCR text, confidence,
  parsed fields, Brave query)
